Please note that file locations may need to be edited according to the users structure of the directory.
Additionally, folders for output need to be created otherwise the R with produce errors.

 =============================================================================
| Create Output Directories:
|(NOTE: The directories created here will contain the files outputed from the scripts.)
|
|  1. Navigate to the directory with the codes
|  2. Create Converge directory
|  3. Create Scratch directory
 =============================================================================
 =============================================================================
| How to run LHS analysis:
|(NOTE:LHS analysis takes 2+ hrs to run. This is due to the optimization command and not LHS sampling)
|
|  1. Open R
|  2. Run DAIS_precali_LHS_C.R
|  
|Create Plots:
|  3. Run LHS_plots_C.R
 =============================================================================
| How to run MCMC analysis:
|(NOTE: MCMC analysis takes a ~5 to 6 hrs to run)
|(NOTE: The seed was not set for the MCMC analysis used in the paper. Even though the chains are converged, 
| estimates may vary ever so slightly because MCMC is a random number generator. This does not impact    
| the overall results and conclusions. The seeds 1234 and 1780 should yield the same distributions and figures.
|
| If you wish to use the exact workspace/files used in the paper analysis, then they can be downloaded at 
| this location: https://download.scrim.psu.edu/Ruckert_etal_DAIS/.)
|
|  1. Open R
|  2. Run DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmc_R_C.R
|
|Check For Convergence:
|  3. Run DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmc_R_C1780.R
|  4. Run DAIS_convergence_plotsR_C.R    
|  
|Create Plots:
|  8. Run MCMC_plots_C.R

 =============================================================================
| Short description of main scripts:
|
|  1. DAIS_data_C.R: Input forcing data, standards, and other important info.
|  2. dais.c: Antarctic ice sheet model.
|  3. DAIS_precali_LHS_C.R: Latin hypercube sampling of the AIS model.
|  4. DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmcR_C.R: Heteroskedastic IID MCMC fitting of the AIS model.      
|  5. DAIS_convergence_plots_C.R: Tests MCMC convergence based on the Potential Scale Reduction 
|     factor, Trace plots, and Heidelberger and Welch's convergence diagnostic.
|  6. DAISobs_likelihood_iid.R: Estimates the likelihood functions for the MCMC methods.
|  7. LHS_plots_C.R & MCMC_plots_C.R: Generates figures shown in the paper.
