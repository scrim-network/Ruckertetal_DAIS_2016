| For the impatient:(NOTE:This datasets take time to load)             |
|  1. Open terminal, open seperate screen, and navigate to directory   |
|  2. Type: Rscript LHS_plots.R                                        |
|  3. Type: Rscript MCMC_plots.R                                       |
 ======================================================================

Required software:
    R
    matlab

Required libraries:
    coda
    lhs
    mcmc (matlab script included)
    R.matlab
    RColorBrewer
    ash
    fields

| How to run MCMC analysis:
|(NOTE:MCMC analysis takes a day to run)
|
|  1. Open terminal, open separate screen, and navigate to directory
|  2. Type: Rscript Initial_Parameters.R (optional, can use previously created "OptimizedInitialParameters.txt)
|  3. Type: cd DAIS_matlab
|  4. Type: matlab -nodisplay -nosplash < DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmc.m      
|  5. Type: cd..
|  6. Type: Rscript DAIS_convergence_plotsR.R (to check for convergence)
|  7. Type: Rscript DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmcmat.R
|  8. Type: Rscript MCMC_plots.R
|
| How to run LHS analysis:
|(NOTE:LHS analysis takes ~2hrs to run)
|
|  1. Open terminal, open seperate screen, and navigate to directory
|  2. Type: Rscript DAIS_precali_LHS.R
|  3. Type: Rscript LHS_plots.R

| Short description of main scripts:
|  The main scripts were used in the analysis of the paper.
|
|  1. DAIS_datal.R & DAIS_data.m: Input forcing data, standards, and other important info.
|  2. DAIS_IceFlux_model.R & DAIS_IceFlux_model.m: Antarctic ice sheet model.
|  3. DAIS_precali_LHS.R: Latin hypercube sampling of the AIS model.
|  4. DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmc.m & DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmcRversion.R: Heteroskedastic 
|     IID MCMC fitting of the AIS model (matlab version used in analysis; R version will run for months).      
|  5. DAIS_convergence_plots.R: Tests MCMC convergence based on the Potential Scale Reduction 
|     factor, Trace plots, and Heidelberger and Welch's convergence diagnostic.
|  6. DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmcmat.R: hindcast and projects AIS melt using MCMC data from matlab.
|  7. DAISobs_likelihood_AR.R: Estimates the likelihood functions for the MCMC methods (if using R version).
|  8. log_lik_calibration_copy.m: Estimates the log-likelihood functions for the MCMC methods.
|  9. log_pri_copy.m: Estimates the prior for the MCMC methods.
|  10. LHS_plots.R & MCMC_plots.R: Generates figures shown in paper.
