| How to run LHS analysis:
|(NOTE:LHS analysis takes ~2hrs to run)
|
|  1. Open R
|  2. Run DAIS_precali_LHS_C.R
|  
|Create Plots:
|  3. Run LHS_plots_C.R
 =============================================================================
| How to run MCMC analysis:
|(NOTE:MCMC analysis takes a ~5 to 6 hrs to run)
|
|  1. Open R
|  2. Run DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmc_R_C.R
|
|Check For Convergence:
|  3. Run DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmc_R_C1780.R

| Short description of main scripts:
|
|  1. DAIS_data_C.R: Input forcing data, standards, and other important info.
|  2. dais.c: Antarctic ice sheet model.
|  3. DAIS_precali_LHS_C.R: Latin hypercube sampling of the AIS model.
|  4. DAIScali_hetero_model_iid_mcmcR_C.R: Heteroskedastic IID MCMC fitting of the AIS model.      
|  5. DAIS_convergence_plots_C.R: Tests MCMC convergence based on the Potential Scale Reduction 
|     factor, Trace plots, and Heidelberger and Welch's convergence diagnostic.
|  6. DAISobs_likelihood_iid.R: Estimates the likelihood functions for the MCMC methods.
|  7. LHS_plots_C.R & MCMC_plots_C.R: Generates figures shown in the paper.
