|  TA:  Antarctic temperature reduced to sea-level                                                      
|  TO:  Volume averaged (200-800m) high latitude (52-70) subsurface ocean temperature                              
|  SL:  Reconstructed sea-level                            
|  GSL: Rate of change of sea-level

| Notes on generating the data:
|  anomalies are with respect to the 1961-1990 mean
|  TA and TO scripts need to be modified to call data from user specified directories
 =============================================================================
|  1. SL & GSL: source “future_seal-level_DAIS.R” 
|  2. TA: source “calculate_Antarctica_mean_temperature_anomalies_adjusted_to_sea_level.sh”
|	2a. Average the monthly values to estimate yearly celsius anomalies
|	2b. Add -18 to the yearly anomalies to adjust to present day 
|  3. TO: source “calculate_volume_averaged_ocean_potential_temperature_around_Antarctica.sh”
|	2a. Add 0.72 to the yearly anomalies to adjust to present day
|	2b. Add 0.055 adjust to line up with Shaffer 2014
